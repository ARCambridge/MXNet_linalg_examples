# Probabilistic Models on MXNet

The Jupyter notebooks in the repository shows the examples that uses the linear algebra operators to implement probabilistic models such as Gaussian process, Bayesian linear regression.

## Dependency

The illustrated notebooks depend on [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) and [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy). These dependency can be installed via pip:
```
pip install  mxnet GPy
